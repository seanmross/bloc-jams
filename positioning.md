## Absolute vs. Relative Positioning

The absolute and relative values change how we can position different elements within the browser container. 

Starting with relative, this value lets us position elements in relation to one another. For example, if you were to create 3 equally sized boxes and positioned them all as relative, they would stack nicely right on top of each other.

Using the absolute value however, the container is like one giant coordinate system, and you can place elements anywhere in the container. You can also move these elements anywhere and they wonâ€™t affect any other elements, whereas using relative values, if you move elements they move with relativity to other elements.
